\subsection{7.7 Reaction Mechanisms}
    A sequence of elementary rxns that sum to the overall rxn. The kinetics of elementary rxns are determined by
    how many molecules have to collide, referred to as the molecularity.\\
    

    Elementary rxns have rate law where $m,n,p\dots$ are equal to stoichiometric coefficients.
