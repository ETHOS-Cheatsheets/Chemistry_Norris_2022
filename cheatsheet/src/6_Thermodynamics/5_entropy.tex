\subsection{6.5 Entropy, S}
    Entropy is a measure of disorder in a system. All spontaneous processes are irreversible. S is a state function.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $\Delta S = \frac{q_\text{rev}}{T}$, $q_\text{rev}$ = heat flow for reversible process
        \item $S = k_b*ln(W)$, $k_b$ = Boltzmann's constant, $W$ = num of microstates
    \end{itemize}
    \bm{$\Delta S > 0$}: increasing microstates\\
    e.g increasing V, increasing T, increasing n, increasing complexity of molecules, melting solids, vaporizing liquids
