\subsection{3.5 Formal charges}
    results if new bondings are formed to satisfy octet rule, ignores electronegativity\\
    \textbf{Determine formal charge in Molecule:}
    \begin{itemize}
        \itemsep0em
        \item split all bondings in middle
        \item atoms formal charge = VE if unpaired $- e^-$ of that atom after splitting bondings
        \item effective charge of molecule = sum of formal charges
    \end{itemize}
