\subsection{3.1 Covalent bondings}
    Two atoms share electron pairs\\
    \textbf{octet rule:} Atom tries to acquire noble state (2 valence electrons for H and He, 8 valence electrons for all other)\\
    \textbf{exceptions:} 
    \begin{itemize}
        \itemsep0em
        \item Odd electrons
        \item Less / more than 8 VE's on central atom
    \end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Lewis structure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \itemsep0em
        \item Write symbols and connect with single bonds
        \item Complete octets around non-central atoms
        \item Place remaining VE around central atom
        \item Try multiple bonds if central atom does not have octet
        \item if multiple lewis structures possible: choose most stable according to formal charge
    \end{itemize}
