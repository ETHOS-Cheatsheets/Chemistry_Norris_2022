\subsection{3.2 Lewis structure}
    \begin{itemize}
        \itemsep0em
        \item Write symbols and connect with single bonds
        \item Complete octets around non-central atoms
        \item Place remaining VE around central atom
        \item Try multiple bonds if central atom does not have octet
        \item if multiple lewis structures possible: choose most stable according to formal charge
    \end{itemize}
