    Heisenbergs uncertainty principle $\Delta x \cdot \Delta p \geq \frac{h}{4 \cdot \pi}$ Due to duality of electrons (acting like waves and elementary entities at the same time), impossible to exactly describe position and momentum simultaneously.\\
    \textbf{Effective nuclear charge (approx.):}   $Z_{eff} = Z-S$\\
    $Z$ = \#protons, $S$ = \#$e^-$ on all full shells
    \vspace{1mm}\\
	In periodic table: $Z_{eff}$ increases from left to right $\rightarrow$ electrons are more attracted and hence atomic radius is smaller, the further right in the periodic table.
